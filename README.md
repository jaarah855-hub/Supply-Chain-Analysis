# Supply Chain Analytics & Inventory Optimization (In Progress) 🚧
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain performance and inventory dynamics in an operational context.
The objective is to study demand variability, stockouts, and inefficiencies, and to evaluate inventory and replenishment strategies using data-driven methods 📊.

The project is currently under active development and is being refined for clarity, robustness, and reproducibility before full publication.

## Key Topics Covered

Demand variability and volatility analysis

Stockout identification and service-level assessment

Inventory and replenishment strategy evaluation

Process inefficiency detection using analytical metrics

Data preparation and transformation for supply chain analysis

## Tools & Technologies (Planned / In Progress) 🛠️

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn)

SQL for data extraction and transformation

Statistical analysis and performance metrics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Scenario analysis and simulation (where applicable)

## Current Status

Data modeling and preparation: Done

Core analytical framework: Done

Results validation and interpretation: pending

Documentation and final notebooks: pending

This repository will be updated incrementally as analyses are finalized and documented 🔄.

### Notes

This project reflects an academic-to-practical approach to supply chain analytics.
While the full implementation is still being finalized, the methodology and analytical thinking are representative of real-world operational analytics problems.
